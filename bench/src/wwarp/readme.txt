Warping with wavelets code.

To use this code, you will need to install jython, to use my .py scripts, and
java. This code will also require the use of the mines jtk, which is located at
…The particular version of java that I use is Java 7.

In the cg folder is my workbench folder for research (bench). Inside the bench folder,
I have the corresponding src folder (obviously for my source code), the build folder, and
the rest is build information for gradle.

The main files that involve presented research on warping with wavelets is in 
wwarp folder.

In each file, there should be a small description of the purpose of why the file exists
in the first few lines of the file.

The files that begin with cwppres… were the files used to generate the figures for
my wavelets and warping PS seismic images presentation, which was presented at the
2014 CWP annual meeting.

The files that begin with nmo deal with different tests of the warping with wavelets
algorithm and one or multiple CMP gathers.

The files main files that are related to warping PS seismic images are waveletwarping.py
and waveletwarpingha.py. The other files represent research in progress or files that I’m
not sure if I will need later on.
